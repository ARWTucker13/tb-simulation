    "narrative": "Gaborone, Botswana \u2013 2012\n\nIn a strategic planning retreat, regional leaders begin drafting the SADC TB-in-Mining Declaration. The room is hot and windowless. Around the table sit public health directors, mine safety regulators, and regional epidemiologists — most of whom haven’t worked together before.\n\nYou’re here at the start of something new: the SADC is drafting its first regional health declaration focused specifically on TB in the mining sector. The crisis has reached a tipping point.\n\nTB rates among mineworkers are as high as 2,500 per 100,000 — more than ten times the general population. HIV co-infection is common. In South Africa alone, over 500,000 ex-mineworkers are living with lung damage, and tens of thousands are still migrating for work each year from Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi, and beyond.\n\nOne delegate from Eswatini opens the meeting bluntly:\n\n“We keep calling this a disease of the lungs. But it’s the structure that’s diseased.”\n\nYou know what they mean:\n\n- Decades of migrant labor systems, created under apartheid and perpetuated through neoliberal mining policy\n- Cramped hostels and dusty tunnels where mineworkers spend 40+ hours a week\n- No cross-border health coverage. No worker compensation. No care once they're sent home.\n\nSome in the room want to focus on case detection and drug resistance. Others want to put forward a broader, structural agenda. It’s your turn to speak."

    "narrative": "Maputo, Mozambique \u2013 August 2012\n\nHealth ministers prepare to sign a regional TB declaration. You’re standing in a drafty ballroom of a Maputo conference center. After two days of negotiation, 15 health ministers from across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are poised to sign what will become the SADC Declaration on TB in the Mining Sector.\n\nThe declaration is historic — the first time TB in mining has been recognized as a regional health and labor issue. But the language is still vague, and there’s disagreement over what exactly to include.\n\nThe working group has drafted four core policy pillars:\n\n**Treatment and Referral**\nEnsure universal access to TB and HIV screening and treatment for all miners — active or retired.\n\n**Cross-Border Surveillance and Harmonization**\nCreate standardized data systems, referral pathways, and treatment protocols that follow miners across borders.\n\n**Dust Control and Occupational Safety**\nEnforce silica dust reduction and issue formal respiratory health protections within the mines.\n\n**Inclusion of Informal and Ex-Miners**\nExpand care to include artisanal miners and ex-mineworkers who often fall through the cracks of formal systems.\n\nBehind closed doors, the priorities differ. South Africa wants a harmonized system. Mozambique pushes for better surveillance. Malawi demands justice for ex-mineworkers. Mining companies are watching closely — worried about liability.\n\nThe Ministers turn to you, as the lead technical advisor from the Global TB Programme.\n\n“We need you to recommend which pillars we prioritize. We can’t push all four equally — not if we want buy-in.”"
